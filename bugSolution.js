//No changes to the code are needed to resolve this specific issue. The break statement is functional as intended. 
// However, here's an alternative example of a for loop, which might be preferred if you want more clarity on the loop termination condition:

function myFunction() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    if (i === 5) {
      break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
    }
  }
}
myFunction();
